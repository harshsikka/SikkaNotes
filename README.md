# SikkaNotes

## A collection of open source notes on complex and often interdisciplinary topics that I study.

The intention here is to build a corpus of advanced, cutting edge knowledge broken down simply for me or anyone else to come back to. PRs are welcome! Please feel free to suggest corrections or annotations/addendums.
